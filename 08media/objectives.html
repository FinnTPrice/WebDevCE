        <h1>Neutral Objectives</h1>
        <p>Almost all objectives grant every team meber who assisted in the KO healing equal to 30% of their max HP (not just the person who registered the last hit) and global exp. <br>
        Regidrago does <em>not</em> provide any healing, and Regieleki only grants exp <strong>locally</strong>.</p>

        <img src="https://img.game8.co/4270506/9a7d48ef8a97bc04ad9f5ff60ed5e160.png/show" alt="Groudon.png" width="600" height="314" class="objective">
        <h2>What does Groudon Do?</h2>
        <p>Groudon spawns at the 2:00 mark on Theia Sky Ruins. When a team defeats Groudon, all members of that team will have their atack power and gaol-scoring speed greatly increased. <br>
        But not only that, if you KO a Pokemon that's under this effect, the effect will transfer to your Pokemon. That way, even the team that didn't defeat Groudon will have a chance to <br>
        keep up, allowing all players to enjoy a heated battle until the time runs out.</p>

        <h2>Groudon Buff</h2>
        <p>The user who secures Groudon gains 30 Aeos Energy, while the rest of their team gains 15 Aeos Energy. After securing, Groudon provides a shield and buff to all living teammates, <br>
        which quadruples goal-scoring speed and boosts all damage against enemy players. Getting KO'd will transfer the buff to the one who KO'd you. The buff does not expire.</p>

        <h2>Buff Scaling</h2>
        <p>Shield Strength: 30% Max HP + 1000 (does not transfer when KO'd)</p>
        <p>Damage boost: 50% increase</p>
        <p>Scoring boost: 300% increase</p>

         <h2>What does Regidrago do?</h2>
         <p>Regidrago spawns at the 8:00 mark on Theia Sky Ruins. When a team defeats Regidrago, the user who secures Regidrago will have an increased goal-scoring speed. After Regidrago <br>
        spawns in the center of the map, Regidrago will roam between the top and bottom of the map, staying in the center. Regidrago can either respawn, or an Altaria camp can spawn in its place.</p>

            3 minutes after it is defeated; it will respawn on the lane it initially spawned in.</p>
        <h2>Regieleki "Buff"</h2>
        <p>If Regieleki reaches a goal, it will reward the team who defeat Regieleki points and make the goal defenseless for up to 25 seconds. Depending on how much health Regieleki had upon <br>
            reaching the goal, the goal will be defenseless for a set amount of time:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>61-100% Health: 25 Second Vulnerability and 20 Points</li>
        <li>41-60% Health: 20 Second Vulnerability and 16 Points</li>
        <li>21-40% Health: 15 Second Vulnerability and 12 Points</li>
