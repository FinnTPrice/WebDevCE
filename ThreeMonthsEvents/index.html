            <h2>August</h2>
            <h3>Band Show Camp Starts</h3>
            <p>As part of the Wasatch High School band, I have been practicing<br>
                the bass guitar so I can play our show from September to November. <br>
                It's pretty fun, but it takes up so much time.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>School Starts</h3>
            <p>I have a full schedule my senior year. I am taking classes such as <br>
            Chemistry 1010, Web Dev, CAPS, Band, Orchestra, Bell Choir, and more. 
            </p>

            <h2>September</h2>
            <h3>Birthday</h3>
            <p>I turn 18 in September, it's pretty scary thinking I'll be an <br>
            adult so soon, but it's also exciting. I think after I turn 18 I'll <br>
            have to raise an apprentice to take my place as the absolute CHAD this <br>
            school needs.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Band Competitions Start</h3>
            <p>On September 26, we will start competing, meaning we need to have our <br>
            whole show memorized, which shouldn't be too hard. Most of my music for the <br>
            show is repeated whole and quarter notes, so it's pretty easy to remember.

            <h2>June</h2>
            <h3>J*b</h3>
            <p>After I'm done with high school I'll have to get a j*b. I'm thinking about <br>
            taking an internship with a prompt engineer agancy. From my understanding I would <br>
            get to intern from home, so I would save money on gas.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Future Schooling</h3>
            <p>I'm planning on taking a gap year after school, so I probably won't go to college <br>
             the first year. If I did go to college I would probably go to UVU just so I don't have to <br>
             transfer credits to another college.
            </p>
